# 🛒 E-commerce Frontend Project

Welcome to my frontend project for an E-commerce application! Here, our focus will be on developing a user interface using React to meet the project requirements. 🚀

## 📝 Description

My frontend project aims to provide an intuitive user experience for an E-commerce platform. We'll implement key functionalities such as user registration, login, product visualization, cart management, order creation, and the ability to view user profiles.

### 🖥️ Core Components

The frontend will consist of the following core components:

- **Register:** Interface for users to register on the platform.
- **Login:** Login screen for registered users.
- **Home:** Main page of the application.
- **Products:** View to display available products.
- **Product:** Specific details of a product.
- **Shopping Cart:** Functionality to manage products added to the cart.
- **Profile:** Display of user data and their orders.
- **Header:** Main navigation of the application.
- **Footer:** Final section of the application.

### 🌐 React Router and Context

I'll use React Router to manage navigation between different views of the application. Additionally, I'll employ Context to handle global data efficiently.

### 🎨 Design and Styling

Design will play a crucial role in this project. I'll emphasize the importance of an attractive and user-friendly design. Moreover, I'll utilize SASS for style management and creating more dynamic interfaces.

### 📐 Constraints

To maintain clean and readable code, I'll adhere to the following constraints:

- Components won't exceed 400 lines of code.
- Functions won't surpass 75 lines of code.
